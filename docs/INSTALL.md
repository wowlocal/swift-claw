# Install, update, or uninstall

Everything about getting the `clawd` binary on and off a machine. For first-run
configuration (bot token, secrets, allowlist), continue with
[GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md).

## 1. Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivan-magda/swift-claw/main/install.sh | sh
```

Pin a release instead of latest:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivan-magda/swift-claw/main/install.sh | CLAWD_VERSION=v0.2.0 sh
```

What the script does:

- Checks the platform: macOS 15+ on Apple Silicon, or Linux x86_64 with glibc 2.38+
  (anything else gets a build-from-source pointer, and the script installs nothing).
- Downloads the release binary, `SHA256SUMS`, the config template, `run-clawd.sh`, and
  the service unit for your platform.
- Verifies every download against `SHA256SUMS`; when the GitHub CLI is installed and
  logged in, it also verifies the build provenance attestation and aborts on mismatch.
- Installs under `~/.swift-claw` — no sudo. Re-running upgrades in place and never
  touches `clawd.env`, sealed secrets, or the database.
- Puts `~/.swift-claw/bin` on your `PATH` by writing `~/.swift-claw/env` and sourcing it
  from your shell rc files. Shells already open keep their old `PATH` — open a new one or
  run `. ~/.swift-claw/env` there. `CLAWD_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1` skips the shell-profile
  edits; `~/.swift-claw/env` is still written.
- Stages the launchd/systemd service unit without starting it — you configure first,
  then start it yourself (section 4).

Prefer not to pipe to sh? Download it first
(`curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivan-magda/swift-claw/main/install.sh`),
read it, then run `sh install.sh` — or follow the manual install below.

> **Version skew:** pinned releases before v0.2.0 lack seal auto-scrub (blank the secret
> lines yourself after sealing), the doctor start hint, and the copy-pasteable
> `CLAW_ALLOWLIST=` line in the `/start` refusal (older releases print your numeric ID in
> prose — copy it by hand).

## 2. Manual install

From the [latest release](https://github.com/ivan-magda/swift-claw/releases/latest),
download the binary for your platform (`clawd-macos-arm64` or `clawd-linux-x86_64`),
`SHA256SUMS`, and `clawd.env.example`. Then verify and install from your download
directory:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
ASSET=clawd-macos-arm64                             # Linux: clawd-linux-x86_64

shasum -a 256 --ignore-missing -c SHA256SUMS &&     # Linux: sha256sum --ignore-missing -c SHA256SUMS
  sudo install -m755 "$ASSET" /usr/local/bin/clawd
```

Every downloaded file must print `OK`; the `&&` stops the install if verification fails.
On a Mac without Homebrew, create the install directory first:
`sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin`.

- **macOS:** browser downloads carry the quarantine flag (curl downloads do not), so
  Gatekeeper blocks the unsigned binary until you clear it:
  `sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/clawd`.
- **Linux:** the binary links the system SQLite (`sudo apt-get install -y libsqlite3-0`)
  and needs glibc 2.38 or newer (e.g. Ubuntu 24.04+); on older systems build from source.

Install the verified config template — your shell runs this file with `source`, so take
it from the checksummed release rather than an unverified copy:

```bash
mkdir -p -m 700 ~/.swift-claw
install -m 600 clawd.env.example ~/.swift-claw/clawd.env
```

The template includes the optional `CLAW_TELEGRAM_GROUP_CHAT_ID`. Enabling it also requires
disabling the bot's privacy mode in BotFather; follow the
[shared-group setup](GETTING_STARTED.md#optional-connect-one-shared-group) before starting the
service so Telegram delivers the history clawd is expected to archive.

Or build from source with a Swift 6.3 toolchain. On Linux, install the SQLite headers
first (`sudo apt-get install -y libsqlite3-dev`); the runtime package alone will not link:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivan-magda/swift-claw.git && cd swift-claw
swift build -c release
sudo install -m755 .build/release/clawd /usr/local/bin/clawd
```

From a source checkout the config template is `.env.example` in the repository root, and
the service files are under `deploy/`.

## 3. Verify downloads (optional)

`SHA256SUMS` lists the SHA-256 of every release asset; `--ignore-missing` checks only the
files present in your directory, and each one must print `OK`. The install script runs
this check for you — this section is for manual installs and extra assurance.

Every binary also carries a build provenance attestation. With the
[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) installed and logged in (`gh auth login`):

```bash
gh attestation verify clawd-<platform> -R ivan-magda/swift-claw
gh attestation verify SHA256SUMS -R ivan-magda/swift-claw    # v0.2.0+
```

A verified `SHA256SUMS` covers every asset transitively: any file that matches a checksum
in an attested manifest came from the release workflow. Releases before v0.2.0 attest
only the binaries.

## 4. Running as a service

Both units are **per-user**: they start when you log in, not at boot, and stop when you
log out. Configure and seal first ([GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md)) — a healthy
`clawd doctor` ends by printing the exact start command for your machine.

### Script install (`~/.swift-claw` layout)

The install script already staged the unit, pointed at `~/.swift-claw/bin`. Start it:

```bash
# macOS
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ivanmagda.swift-claw.plist

# Linux
systemctl --user enable --now swift-claw.service
```

### Manual install (`/usr/local/bin` layout)

Download `run-clawd.sh` plus your platform's unit (`com.ivanmagda.swift-claw.plist` or
`swift-claw.service`) from the same release and verify them against `SHA256SUMS` as in
section 3. You install `run-clawd.sh` as root and your machine runs it at every login,
which is reason enough not to take it from an unverified source.

macOS:

```bash
sudo install -m755 run-clawd.sh /usr/local/bin/run-clawd.sh
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents && cp com.ivanmagda.swift-claw.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ivanmagda.swift-claw.plist
```

Linux:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user && cp swift-claw.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user enable --now swift-claw.service
```

### Staying on after logout

- **Linux:** `sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER` lets the user manager run without a
  session. Without it, a service installed over SSH stops when you disconnect and does
  not come back after a reboot.
- **macOS:** enable automatic login for the account; that keeps the LaunchAgent, which is
  the simple path. A system LaunchDaemon in `/Library/LaunchDaemons` runs as root, where
  `$HOME` is `/var/root`, so the wrapper looks for its config in the wrong place and
  `clawd` exits 10 — if you go that route, pin the account and paths explicitly with
  `UserName`, `CLAW_ENV_FILE`, and `CLAW_STATE_ROOT` in the plist.

### Logs and exit codes

- **macOS:** `/tmp/clawd.out.log` and `/tmp/clawd.err.log`.
- **Linux:** `journalctl --user -u swift-claw -f`.

A second `clawd` against the same state root refuses to boot (file lock), and a Telegram
409 conflict is logged as critical. The commands that write into the state root take that
same lock — `clawd secrets seal`, `clawd auth login` / `logout`, and `clawd mcp set-token`
/ `clear-token` — so stop the service before running them. Read-only commands
(`clawd doctor`, `clawd auth status`, `clawd mcp list` / `probe`) are safe against a
running daemon. Exit codes are diagnostic:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 10 | invalid config |
| 11 | secret loading failed |
| 12 | another instance holds the state-root lock |
| 13 | storage error |

## 5. Updating

**Script layout:** re-run the one-liner from section 1. It upgrades the binary and
service unit in place, preserves `clawd.env`, sealed secrets, and the database, and
restarts the service if it was running.

**Manual layout:** re-download the binary and `SHA256SUMS` from the new release, re-verify
as in section 2, `sudo install` over the old binary, and restart the service
(`launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.ivanmagda.swift-claw` on macOS,
`systemctl --user restart swift-claw.service` on Linux).

The two layouts do not mix: re-running the script on a manual install creates the
`~/.swift-claw/bin` layout alongside `/usr/local/bin/clawd`. The script notices the old
binary, prints that the new install supersedes it, and shows the removal command.

## 6. Uninstall

**Script layout** — remove the binary and service, keep config, secrets, and data:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivan-magda/swift-claw/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall
```

Also delete `~/.swift-claw` (config, secrets, database):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivan-magda/swift-claw/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall --purge
```

A plain `--uninstall` keeps `~/.swift-claw/env` because your shell rc files still source
it. After `--purge`, remove the `. "$HOME/.swift-claw/env"` line from your shell rc files
by hand, or shells will report a missing file at startup. The script never touches a
custom `CLAW_STATE_ROOT` outside `~/.swift-claw` — delete that directory yourself.

**Manual layout, macOS:**

```bash
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.ivanmagda.swift-claw
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ivanmagda.swift-claw.plist
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/clawd /usr/local/bin/run-clawd.sh
rm -rf ~/.swift-claw
```

**Manual layout, Linux:**

```bash
systemctl --user disable --now swift-claw.service
rm ~/.config/systemd/user/swift-claw.service
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/clawd
rm -rf ~/.swift-claw
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```
