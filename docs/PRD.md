| **Related** | [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) · [`teleclaw-prompt.md`](./teleclaw-prompt.md) · research: [impl-grounding](./research/swift-claw-impl-grounding-2026-06-15.md), [best-practices](./research/swift-claw-best-practices-2026-06-15.md), [openclaw-hermes study](./research/persistent-agents-openclaw-hermes.md) |

> **Clean-room notice.** swift-claw is an original implementation in the same *product category* as OpenClaw / Hermes / the teleclaw-prompt brief. It does **not** copy or reproduce OpenClaw, Hermes, or the author's prior `swift-claude-code`. Those are references and inspiration only.

---

## 1. Summary

swift-claw is a **persistent, always-on, single-owner personal AI assistant**, controlled through **Telegram**, implemented in **pure Swift**. It runs as a long-lived local-first daemon on the owner's Mac (and any box with a Swift toolchain), holds durable per-conversation state, remembers facts across restarts, can read the web and the workspace, and — in later phases — can act through a small set of sandboxed tools behind explicit approvals and reach out proactively on a schedule. The design priority is **daily-driver robustness** and **secure-by-default** behavior over breadth or cleverness.

**v1 is a useful daily driver, not a demo.** The v1 slice (defined in §9) is conversational + durable memory + read-only tools (web search/fetch, workspace file read) + streaming replies — the smallest thing that earns daily use over the official ChatGPT/Claude apps. Write/shell tools, sandbox, approvals, and scheduling/proactive arrive in later phases.

## 2. Background & motivation

The author has already built a Claude Code–style coding agent (`swift-claude-code`): a single ReAct loop with tools, sub-agents, compaction, a task DAG, and a skill loader. swift-claw studies and builds a *different* class of system — the **persistent, multi-channel personal assistant** — keeping the proven "one reused agent loop behind thin surfaces" idea but adding the parts a coding agent lacks: a long-running gateway, durable cross-session memory, a messaging channel with an access boundary, a scheduler, and a sandboxed tool/approval layer.

Why Swift: one self-contained binary per platform with no runtime to install underneath — no Node, Python, or Docker — plus a strong concurrency model (Swift 6 strict concurrency / actors), good performance, and first-class macOS integration, while staying Linux-portable. Not a *static* binary: it links the platform C++/Objective-C runtimes, the Swift runtime, system frameworks, and the system `libsqlite3` like any Swift binary.

## 3. Goals & non-goals

### 3.1 Goals
- **G1.** A daily-driver assistant the owner actually uses every day from Telegram — earned at v1 (memory + read-only web/file + streaming), not deferred.
- **G2.** Always-on: survives restarts, crashes, and machine sleep/wake; supervised by launchd (macOS) / systemd (Linux) with restart throttling.
- **G3.** Secure-by-default: untrusted inbound is gated; dangerous capabilities are off or approval-gated; the security boundary is enforced in code, not in the prompt; access and rate-limit checks **fail closed**.
- **G4.** Persistent: conversations, memory, schedules, approvals, and audit all survive restarts.
- **G5.** Provider-portable: swap LLM provider/model via config behind **one `LLMProvider` contract** — an OpenAI-compatible endpoint the owner configures, or a ChatGPT subscription the owner logs into (FR-P5). Authentication is a separate concern from the wire format, so adding a provider adds an adapter, never a branch in the agent loop.
- **G6.** Local-first & private: data stays on the owner's machine; no third party beyond the chosen LLM endpoint and Telegram. The owner can export and delete their data.
- **G7.** Maintainable & legible: boring architecture, small well-bounded modules, well-tested; suitable to write a teaching series about.
- **G8.** Portable: macOS-primary, but the same source builds and runs on Linux.

### 3.2 Non-goals (v1)
- **NG1.** Multi-tenant operation or more than one configured shared Telegram chat. A deployment
  still has one owner, but may opt one numeric group/supergroup id into the bounded shared-chat
  surface described below.
- **NG2.** Channels other than Telegram (no Slack/Discord/iMessage/WhatsApp). The channel layer stays abstractable, but only Telegram is implemented.
- **NG3.** Speech *synthesis* (TTS) and an A2UI canvas or companion device "nodes." Inbound voice notes **are** transcribed, on-device, on macOS 26 (see FR-G6); on Linux and older macOS the feature is inert and they get the canned refusal.
- **NG4.** A web UI / REST API surface (OpenAI-compatible `/v1` server, ACP server) — possible later, not v1. (Note: `status`/`doctor` and Telegram `/status` are **not** this; they are a CLI subcommand and a chat command, see FR-O2.)
- **NG5.** Autonomous skill creation / a Curator / RL trajectory export.
- **NG6.** Webhook mode for Telegram (long-polling only in v1; webhook is a later option).
- **NG7.** Cloud/SaaS hosting, account systems, billing.
- **NG8.** Image *output* — generating, editing, or sending images — and every inbound image surface other than a photo message. **Photo messages are supported** (see FR-G6); an image sent as a **document** ("send as file"), a **sticker**, and an **animation** are not. Replying to a photo does not re-attach it: clawd never reads `reply_to_message`, so that photo reaches the model only if it is still inside the session's history window. An **album** is not one multi-image turn either: Telegram delivers one update per photo, so it becomes one turn per photo, and only the captioned one carries the caption.
- **NG9.** A provider *pool* and per-call USD attribution dashboards. v1 routes over at most two owner-configured routes — a primary and one optional fallback (FR-R3) — with no credential pools, no weighted or model-aware routing, and no automatic provider discovery; and it has a USD spend **breaker**, not a dashboard.
- **NG10.** *(bounds FR-P5)* **Sharing or importing another tool's credentials** — notably Codex CLI's `~/.codex/auth.json` — shelling out to or supervising a Codex subprocess, multiple accounts, credential pools, live credential mutation while the daemon runs, and subscription providers other than ChatGPT. Also out: **a per-provider environment-variable namespace** (`CLAW_CHATGPT_*` and the like) and a configurable subscription endpoint or client identity. Subscription auth adds exactly **one** configuration selector — a provider-qualified model value — and structured configuration (`config.toml`) stays deferred; it is the mechanism a future provider's own settings will use.

## 4. Target user & operating context

- **Who:** the author (a single technical owner), self-hosting.
- **Where:** primary deployment is the owner's Mac (Apple Silicon, macOS 26); secondary is any Linux box with a Swift toolchain (VPS / home server).
- **How accessed:** a private Telegram bot in owner DMs and, when explicitly configured, one
  group/supergroup whose participants address it by exact `@username` mention.
- **Trust:** the *owner* is trusted; everything arriving over the wire (messages, web pages, tool output, attachments) is **untrusted data**, never instructions.

## 5. Use cases (capabilities)

All capability areas are in scope over time; the v1 cut and later phasing are in §9. Capabilities tagged *(v1)* are part of the daily-driver milestone; others are deferred.

### 5.1 Conversational assistant *(v1)*
- *As the owner, I DM the bot a question and get a useful, in-context answer, with my recent conversation remembered.*
- Multi-turn context within a conversation; survives daemon restart.
- **Streaming replies:** the answer appears incrementally (first tokens fast), not as one delayed block.
- Two quick messages produce two **in-order, non-interleaved** replies (strict per-session ordering — a plain message queues; only `/stop` cancels the current turn and `/new` resets). See FR-R4.
- Long answers are split safely (no broken code fences) and fall back to plain text if formatting fails.
- On provider failure/outage or a hit budget cap, the owner gets a **plain-language message**, never silence or a raw error (see FR-R5).

### 5.1.1 Shared Telegram chat *(optional)*
- The owner may configure one numeric group or supergroup id. Every text message and caption the
  bot receives there is archived, while only a message carrying an exact Telegram mention of the
  bot starts an LLM turn.
- A forum topic is its own ordered conversation lane. The answer is delivered to the same topic;
  other topics may run concurrently.
- Recent context comes from the current topic. FTS recall may retrieve older messages from any
  topic in the configured chat, but never from an owner DM or another chat.
- Group content is always untrusted. Group turns receive no owner memory, workspace files, skills,
  schedules, MCP, or executable/write/read tools. Telegram control commands and approvals remain
  owner-DM surfaces.
- “Full history” means every supported update received and durably committed after the feature was
  enabled. Telegram Bot API does not backfill messages from before the bot could receive them.

### 5.2 Notes & long-term memory *(v1)*
- *"Remember that my timezone is Europe/Berlin"* → durable fact, recalled in future sessions.
- A curated long-term memory file plus a searchable archive of past conversations.
- The owner can **review** remembered facts (with provenance) and **delete** them.
- Durable facts are written **only on explicit confirmation** (configurable), shown verbatim before saving, and **flushed before compaction**.
- Cross-session recall via full-text search over the conversation archive.

### 5.3 Tools: read-only web & file *(v1)*
- *"Read my notes/project.md and draft a status update"* / *"fetch this URL and summarize."*
- Web search, web fetch, and workspace file **read** are the v1 tool surface. They are read-only, idempotent, low-blast-radius, and run automatically in the **`safe`** tier (no approval tap).
- Read-only tools are still subject to the **exfiltration gate** (see FR-T6): a fetch in a turn that already ingested untrusted content and touched private data requires approval.

### 5.4 Tools: write, shell & sandbox *(later phase)*
- Workspace-scoped file **write**; shell/code execution.
- Powerful, consequential tools run **inside a sandbox** and **behind explicit Telegram approvals**; nothing dangerous is enabled by default.
- The **enforced lethal-trifecta gate** (FR-T7) forces the approval path when a tainted session attempts a privileged or egress action.

### 5.5 Reminders, scheduling & proactive *(later phase)*
- *"Every weekday at 08:00 Europe/Berlin, summarize my unread items and message me."*
- Natural-language → schedule; restart-safe; fires once per occurrence (DST-correct); no duplicate delivery; **confirm-before-arm** for any new LLM-parsed schedule.
- Opt-in proactive check-ins / heartbeat with **quiet hours** and **frequency caps**; default OFF; reduced-privilege execution.
- Delivery routed back to the owner's Telegram DM.

### 5.6 Provider access & subscription login *(P-auth)*
- *As the owner, I authenticate swift-claw with my ChatGPT subscription and use an eligible model — without owning, paying for, or pasting an API key.*
- `clawd auth login` runs a device-code login in the terminal: it prints a URL and a short code to enter in the browser, waits, then discovers which models the subscription can **actually** use and prints the exact one-line setting to apply. The owner applies it — login never edits config, plists, or shell profiles on their behalf.
- `clawd auth status` says whether a credential exists and whether it is fresh, expiring, or expired, **without touching the network** and while the daemon runs. `clawd auth logout` removes it locally.
- **The configured OpenAI-compatible route is unchanged and stays the default.** One setting chooses between the two, and every existing model value keeps its current meaning — switching back is a one-line change.
- Subscription calls need no API key and incur no API billing. **Budgets still apply**: only the dollar caps go quiet, because a plan-included call has no dollar cost to cap.
- Failures are honest and actionable: *"authentication required — log in"* is a different message from *"your plan can't use this"* and *"you hit a quota, retry later"*, and **only the first one mentions logging in.**
- **This route is unofficial (R7)** — it is not a supported ChatGPT API, and the vendor can change or withdraw it without notice.

### 5.7 Skills: procedures the owner writes once *(P-skills)*
- *As the owner, I write a procedure once as `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and the agent follows it whenever a task calls for it — without me pasting it into every message.*
- Every installed skill appears in the turn as one index line (name + description). The agent picks the matching one by **name** and loads its body; it never types a path, and no skill body rides along until it is loaded.
- A loaded skill is **owner-authored workspace material**: it is followed as task guidance and does **not** taint the session, so private memory stays available for the rest of it. The licence stops at guidance — a skill can never hand out a tool, waive an approval, or loosen policy.
- Authoring faults are reported, not swallowed: a missing frontmatter block, a name outside the identifier shape, a name that disagrees with its directory, and two directories claiming one name each produce a notice naming the skill, and the skill is skipped.
- The index has its own slice of the context budget. When it overflows, the prompt says how many skills it is showing and the owner is told which ones were left out.
- The owner can send `/skills` for a fresh, read-only scan that lists every accepted descriptor and
  every rejection. Full `clawd doctor` and Telegram `/status` summarize the same workspace state as
  accepted and rejected counts plus whether the complete index fits the absolute skills cap.


### 5.8 Tools from MCP servers *(P-mcp)*
- *As the owner, I point swift-claw at an MCP server I already use and its tools show up in chat, without writing an adapter for each one.*
- The owner lists servers in a config file and stores each server's token with a CLI command; the daemon reads both at startup and the tools appear beside the built-ins.
- **Remote tools are treated as the least-trusted tools in the registry**: every one asks for approval by default, their results enter the context as untrusted data, and calling one counts as egress to an arbitrary destination. The owner can lower a *named* tool to no-tap; nothing can raise one to the sandbox tier.
- **Nothing the model says can add a server, change which tools exist, or reveal a token.** Managing servers is a CLI-and-config job; from Telegram the owner can only ask for status.
- A server that is down, slow, or misbehaving is skipped with a stated reason — the assistant still starts and the other servers still work.

## 6. Functional requirements

Requirements tagged *(v1)* are part of the daily-driver milestone (§9); others land in their phase. Technical mechanism detail lives in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md); this section states the product contract.

### 6.1 Gateway & lifecycle
- **FR-G1.** *(v1)* A single long-running daemon owns Telegram connectivity, config, access control, routing, sessions, run lifecycle, tools, memory, scheduler, provider calls, logging, and shutdown.
- **FR-G2.** *(v1)* Telegram updates are received via **long-polling** (`getUpdates`). **Durability invariant:** an update is claimed (deduplicated) and its inbound message + side effects persisted in one transaction **before** the confirmed offset advances, so no update is missed or double-processed across restarts. The normative sequence (claim → access-check → persist → advance offset) and the warning that the dedup check must never span an `await` live in [`ARCHITECTURE.md` §6.1].
- **FR-G3.** *(v1)* Updates are normalized into an internal `IncomingMessage`; replies go out as `OutgoingReply`. Duplicate `update_id`s are ignored (idempotent intake). A single malformed update never wedges intake (offset advances past it; counter exposed in `doctor`).
- **FR-G4.** *(v1)* Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT: stop intake → drain in-flight turn → flush → checkpoint + close DB → exit. Crash → supervised restart with throttling.
- **FR-G5.** *(v1)* **Single-instance guard.** At startup the daemon acquires a cross-process advisory lock on the state root; a second `clawd` refuses to boot rather than fighting over `getUpdates`. A Telegram **409 Conflict** (another poller active) is a distinct, loud error surfaced in `doctor`, not a generic retryable 5xx.
- **FR-G6.** *(v1)* **Non-text intake.** Every inbound update type is enumerated and handled deterministically — never a silent drop, never a crash:
  - **Photos are read.** A photo, captioned or not, is downloaded within a byte cap and shown to the model. It needs a vision-capable model, and a model that cannot see produces an owner-facing message naming that cause.
  - **Turning photos off never costs the owner their question.** With `CLAW_IMAGE_INPUT=false` a bare photo gets the canned reply, but a **captioned** one still runs as a turn carrying that caption — the product tells owners on a text-only model to set this flag, so their "what does this say" must still be answered rather than discarded.
  - **Voice notes are transcribed** on-device on macOS 26; elsewhere the feature is inert and they get the canned reply (consistent with NG3). A voice note sent **with a caption** is a text turn and is never transcribed: written text outranks the attachment.
  - Media that clawd still cannot read (document / sticker / video / audio) gets a friendly "I can't read X yet" reply.
  - **Caption text on media clawd cannot read is captured and processed as text.** A photo's caption instead travels *with* the photo, as one turn.
  - A photo caption and a voice transcript are **never** parsed as a command and never answer a pending confirmation. Neither carries proof it originated with the owner, so neither may steer a control path.
  - An **edited user message** is treated as a `/retry` of that turn.

### 6.2 Access control & rate limiting
- **FR-A1.** *(v1)* **Default-deny.** No one can use the bot until their **numeric Telegram user ID** is allowlisted. Usernames are never used as a security boundary or resolved anywhere.
- **FR-A2.** *(v1)* Unknown senders never reach the LLM or any tool; they get a minimal "private bot" reply only. The reply itself never grants or reveals access and never lists allowlist contents (see FR-A5).
- **FR-A3.** *(v1)* Allowlist is configurable (config file + persisted) and survives restart. In v1 the owner ID enters the allowlist via the **config file**; a one-time **pairing flow** that writes a durable numeric ID is a later phase.
- **FR-A4.** *(v1)* Per-user and global **rate limits** (token-bucket); honor Telegram's `retry_after`. The rate limiter **fails closed** (throttle) on internal/store/lock error.
- **FR-A5.** *(v1)* **First-run / onboarding.** On a fresh install the owner must be able to discover their own numeric ID and self-allowlist:
  - An **unknown** sender's `/start` may echo **that sender's own numeric ID** (so they can paste it into the config) and nothing else — it never reveals who is on the allowlist and never grants access.
  - An **allowlisted** sender's `/start` shows the normal welcome/help.
  - `doctor` confirms **"at least one owner is allowlisted"** and fails the check otherwise.
  - **Pairing (later phase):** a high-entropy, single-use, expiring, rate-limited, audited secret provisioned out-of-band by the owner; pairing writes go through the same audited, idempotent allowlist path.
- **FR-A6.** *(later phase)* The approval-callback path runs the **same** default-deny numeric-ID check, and a pending privileged action can be approved **only** by the recorded owner of that action. Detail in FR-T5/§6.7.

### 6.3 Sessions & persistence
- **FR-S1.** *(v1)* Per-owner DM session keyed `telegram:dm:<userId>`; persisted in SQLite and survives restarts.
- **FR-S2.** *(v1)* Messages, runs, tool calls, memory items, scheduled jobs (their phase), provider usage, and audit events are stored in SQLite via explicit migrations, with a proper relational spine (foreign keys, `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`). Approvals are added in the tools phase.
- **FR-S3.** *(v1)* **Idempotency, split honestly into two mechanisms** (full detail in [`ARCHITECTURE.md` §7]):
  - **(a) DB-internal dedup:** inbound `update_id`, usage rows, and audit rows are deduplicated via `INSERT OR IGNORE` inside one write transaction.
  - **(b) External side effects (outbound replies):** delivered via a **transactional outbox** — intent committed → effect performed **at-least-once** → completion recorded. Each reply chunk is its own outbox step so a partial multipart send recovers.
  - The inbound message + run row **commit before** the outbound reply is sent (ordering invariant). Exactly-once across the network is impossible and is not claimed.
- **FR-S4.** *(v1)* **Data export & deletion.** The owner can export and delete **conversation history** (not just memory items). Deletion also removes/rebuilds the full-text-search rows so deleted content is not recoverable via the index. A retention/compaction policy bounds the message archive. (Conversation content is stored un-redacted by design; at-rest file encryption is the compensating control — see NFR-Privacy.)

### 6.4 Agent runtime
- **FR-R1.** *(v1)* The core loop: receive → authorize + rate-limit → resolve session → persist user message → build context → call provider → (later: dispatch tools / request approvals) → persist results → send reply → record usage + audit.
- **FR-R2.** *(v1)* Context is assembled within a deterministic size budget with explicit truncation markers. The **single normative source** for ordering, per-section priority, the truncatable flag, the budget formula (`inputCap = modelMax − reservedOutput`, greedy by priority, grapheme counting), and per-file caps is [`ARCHITECTURE.md` §9]; this FR defers to it.
- **FR-R3.** *(v1)* Runs support cancellation (`/stop`), timeouts, and retries with capped exponential backoff + full jitter at exactly one layer with a retry budget. Hard caps with **pinned numeric defaults** (set in [`ARCHITECTURE.md` §5]): max turns, max tool calls, max input tokens, reserved-output / `max_tokens`, wall-clock deadline. A **bounded, non-null `max_tokens` is mandatory** — `doctor` rejects a config with null `max_tokens`. An **optional second route** (`CLAW_LLM_FALLBACK_MODEL`, unset by default) finishes a turn when the primary cannot answer: only on failures that are safe to re-issue, with a cooldown on the failed route, the active route's own cost policy at the budget gate, and a notice to the owner on each transition ([`ARCHITECTURE.md` §8.6]). Wider provider pools stay out (NG9).
- **FR-R4.** *(v1)* **Per-session ordering.** Each session has a single processing lane: turns run in **strict FIFO** order. A plain message **queues** behind the current turn; only `/stop` (cancel current) and `/new` (reset + cancel) **supersede**. The owner sees two quick messages answered in order, never interleaved. (Mechanism — a `SessionActor` chaining each turn after the prior, and the fact that Swift actors do **not** serialize across `await` — is in [`ARCHITECTURE.md` §5].)
- **FR-R5.** *(v1)* **User-visible degradation contract.** This is the concrete form of "stop and ask":
  - On provider failure/timeout after retries, the owner gets a plain-language message ("I couldn't reach the model, please try again") with **no secrets or stack trace**.
  - On a hit budget cap, a specific message naming the cap ("I stopped because the per-day spend cap was hit").
  - The typing indicator is **cleared** in both cases.
- **FR-R6.** *(v1)* **Run state machine.** A run carries an explicit state (`PENDING / RUNNING / DONE / FAILED / CANCELLED / SUPERSEDED`; `AWAITING_APPROVAL` is added with the tools phase). A boot **reconciliation sweep** resolves orphaned states (any `RUNNING` at boot → `FAILED` or safe re-enqueue via the outbox). Transition tables and crash-recovery edges live in [`ARCHITECTURE.md` §19.1].

### 6.5 LLM provider
- **FR-P1.** *(v1)* One **`LLMProvider` contract** is the model-execution interface, with two wire routes behind it. **(a)** *(v1)* An **OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions** endpoint: provider/model/`base_url`/key are configurable, enabling swap between OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, local Ollama/LM Studio, an Anthropic OpenAI-compat endpoint, or a LiteLLM proxy — without code changes. `base_url` is **pinned/allowlisted** and documented as a trust dependency. **(b)** *(P-auth)* A **ChatGPT subscription** route (FR-P5). The route is selected by a single configuration value — a provider-qualified model reference — and **every unqualified model value keeps its current meaning and behavior**, including values containing `/`. Mechanism in [`ARCHITECTURE.md` §8].
- **FR-P2.** *(v1 seam)* Behind an `LLMProvider` protocol so a future *native* adapter (e.g. Anthropic Messages for prompt caching) can be added. **Authentication is a separate seam from the wire format**: a provider's credential lifecycle — a static key or an OAuth grant with refresh — is never a property of the agent loop, so the agent runtime, scheduler, and gateway never learn which provider they are talking to.
- **FR-P3.** *(v1 — not approved)* Records token usage and computes per-call cost from a local pricing table (feeds the USD budget, FR-R3/NFR-Cost). Per-call USD attribution **dashboards** are deferred (NG9). **A plan-included call records its tokens against a confirmed zero cost with an `included_plan` cost source** — an audited zero, distinguishable from an unpriced one (FR-P5).
- **FR-P4.** *(v1)* **Streaming.** Replies stream incrementally: an SSE parser maps chunks onto throttled Telegram `editMessageText` (coalesced, min-interval ~1–2 s, first chunk sent ASAP). If streaming is unavailable, fall back to blocking completion and re-issue `sendChatAction` every ~4 s for the turn's duration. The metric is **perceived latency (time-to-first-token)**, not just first-reply latency. Disabling streaming is a **presentation** choice — it turns off incremental Telegram drafts; it does not promise anything about a provider's wire transport.
- **FR-P5.** *(P-auth)* **ChatGPT subscription authentication.** The owner can authenticate with a ChatGPT subscription and run an eligible model **with no API key and no API billing**:
  - `clawd auth login` performs a **device-code** login, stores a refreshable credential **encrypted under the state root**, lists the models the subscription can actually use, and prints the exact configuration line — `CLAW_LLM_MODEL=openai-chatgpt/<model>` — for the owner to apply. It **never** edits `.env`, a launchd plist, a shell profile, or a future config file.
  - `clawd auth status` — read-only, network-free, and safe while the daemon runs — reports presence, expiry, and freshness. It never displays a token or an account identifier. `clawd auth logout` removes the local credential; it is **local deletion, not server-side revocation**, so an issued token may stay valid until the vendor expires it, and the owner is told so.
  - **Login and logout require the daemon to be stopped** — the running daemon is the only process allowed to refresh and save a credential — and they say exactly that rather than failing obscurely.
  - **Selection is one setting** (FR-P1): a provider-qualified model value picks the subscription route; every other value picks the configured route, unchanged. **No provider-specific environment variables are added** (NG10).
  - **Budgets still apply.** Token, turn, tool-call, and wall-clock ceilings all stay enforced; only the USD gates are skipped, because a plan-included call has no dollar cost to cap. **This is not an unlimited-budget mode.** Because this route cannot enforce an output cap on the wire, a token budget may overshoot by at most one in-flight call — see [`ARCHITECTURE.md` §8].
  - **Failures are distinct and actionable** (FR-R5): authentication required → *"stop clawd and run `clawd auth login`"*; entitlement/access denial and quota/throttle say what they are and **never** send the owner to log in again.
  - **The route is unofficial** (R7), and swift-claw never reads, imports, modifies, or shares another tool's credentials (NG10).

### 6.6 Memory *(v1)*
- **FR-M1.** Plain-text workspace identity/memory files (persona, operating rules, user profile, tool notes, curated memory) injected into context with size caps and truncation markers; missing files must not crash.
- **FR-M2.** Durable facts stored only on explicit ask/confirmation (configurable); each item has type, content, source/provenance, timestamps, importance, sensitivity, and supports deletion (`confidence` deferred until model-proposed/autonomous memory; `visibility` is named `sensitivity`, consistent with FR-M5's "high-sensitivity"; Inc 3a). Confirm-on-write shows the **exact verbatim text** post-Unicode-normalization, with invisible / zero-width / bidi characters made visible or stripped.
- **FR-M3.** Memory is flushed to disk **before** any compaction/summarization. **Bounded caps are a hard v1 contract:** MEMORY ≤ 2200 and USER ≤ 1375 graphemes (`String.count`); on overflow the runtime **errors and forces consolidation** rather than silently truncating. (This resolves the prior open question — it is the contract, not an open item.)
- **FR-M4.** Cross-session recall via SQLite **FTS5** search over the archive (external-content mode over `messages`, single delete source of truth — detail in [`ARCHITECTURE.md` §7]).
- **FR-M5.** Memory and tool output are **untrusted context**: MEMORY/USER files are injected inside the **same untrusted/labeled wrapper** as other data — **never the system tier** — so poisoned memory cannot claim system authority. They may never override system/security policy. Pattern scanning of memory writes is **defense-in-depth only**, not an acceptance gate. High-sensitivity memory is **not auto-injected** into a turn that has already ingested untrusted content. Workspace skills are labeled the same way and are read under the same rule (FR-T9).
- **FR-M6.** **`/memory review` + `/memory delete`** let the owner inspect remembered facts with provenance and forget them (confirm-gated). Durable memory **persists** across `/new` by design; forgetting is a separate, explicit path (see FR-O3).

### 6.7 Tools, policy & approvals
- **FR-T1.** *(v1 registry; full policy gate in the tools phase)* A fixed tool registry with explicit input/output schemas. Each tool declares a **risk tier**: `safe` | `ask` | `dangerous` | `disabled`, plus timeout, sandbox requirement, and audit behavior. A **per-tool output cap** (default ~25k tokens) is enforced and counts toward the next turn's input budget.
- **FR-T2.** **Default risk-tier table.** Read-only + idempotent + low-blast-radius ops — **`web_search`, `web_fetch`, workspace file READ, skill load** — default to **`safe`** (run automatically, no tap). Only writes, shell/exec, and egress-from-sandbox are `ask` / `dangerous`. `disabled` never runs. (Batch approval and a time-boxed auto-approve toggle are deferred to the tools phase.)
- **FR-T3.** Policy is enforced **in code** before dispatch — never delegated to the model. Tool output can never change system instructions.
- **FR-T4.** *(v1 for read; write in the tools phase)* File tools are workspace-scoped: every path is resolved to its **canonical real path** after `..`/symlink resolution and **asserted to lie within the workspace root** (a tested invariant covering both the link and its final target); outputs are size-capped; secrets are redacted in args/results; no arbitrary network or shell by default.
- **FR-T5.** *(tools phase)* **Approvals** are bound to the **exact** concrete action (tool + fully-resolved target + canonical-args hash + policy version), persisted as PENDING (restart-resumable) with the recorded **owner user ID**, expire to **DENY**, re-validate args **and** policy version at execution, execute the originally-recorded args, and are never cached into a future auto-run. The approval prompt shows the **fully-resolved** target (absolute path after symlink/`..` resolution; full URL incl. query/body, never model-truncated), a **taint banner** when the turn ingested untrusted content, and the **blast radius** (create vs overwrite, egress yes/no). Redaction hides secrets, **not** the destination fields the owner needs to judge risk. The callback `callback_id` is a ≥128-bit single-use random nonce bound to the session (never a sequential/PK/counter value); the callback handler runs the same default-deny check and honors the action only if `callback.from.id` equals the recorded owner ID.
- **FR-T6.** *(v1 for the read-only tools; full enforcement in the tools phase)* **Exfiltration gate.** `canExfiltrate` covers **every** outbound network sink — the LLM provider endpoint **and** `web_fetch` — not just "a different chat." Once a session has ingested untrusted content **and** touched private data, a subsequent `web_fetch` requires approval showing the full resolved URL; fetch args containing substrings of MEMORY/USER files or secret-shaped tokens are **blocked by redaction before dispatch**. There is no "reply to owner DM ⇒ exfil-free" exemption. v1's "gated by approval" is the ephemeral text approval: an in-memory single-slot pending entry whose `yes` arms a one-turn grant bound to the exact approved action (tool + canonical target; for `web_fetch`, the canonical URL); anything else — including restart — denies. The durable approval FSM, callback auth, and nonces remain Inc 5a. Outbound sinks are classified: pinned trusted egress (the LLM `base_url` and the search endpoint — owner-configured and pinned, their providers see model-authored content under their ToS) is protected by the arg guard and config pinning, not approval; arbitrary-destination egress (`web_fetch`) additionally requires the trifecta approval. The owner explicitly accepts the search provider seeing model-authored queries.
- **FR-T7.** *(tools phase)* **Enforced lethal-trifecta gate.** Taint is a **sticky, persisted session property** (`session.tainted = true` once any untrusted content is ingested — durable memory and a loaded skill are the two exceptions: both are labeled untrusted, neither taints). When a tainted session attempts a privileged or egress action, the approval path is **forced in code** (or `/new` is required), independent of the tool's own risk tier. Compaction/rolling-summary **preserves an untrusted-provenance marker** and never folds untrusted tool output into the trusted summary.
- **FR-T8.** *(v1)* **SSRF protection.** `web_fetch` refuses non-public destinations: after DNS resolution and following redirects, the target must be a public IP — private/RFC-1918, loopback, link-local (incl. the `169.254.169.254` cloud-metadata endpoint), and reserved ranges are blocked. A tested invariant.
- **FR-T9.** *(P-skills)* **Workspace skills.** A skill is a directory under `skills/` holding a `SKILL.md` whose frontmatter declares `name` and `description`. Identity is settled at scan time: the name matches `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$` (1–64 characters) **and** equals its directory name, the description is capped and single-line, and two directories claiming one name drop **both** — silent shadowing decides identity where no principled winner exists. The context carries only the index; a body is loaded by a `safe`, no-egress tool that takes a **name** and resolves it against a fresh scan, so frontmatter never becomes a path component and the model never types a path. Index and body render under one label, and the system prompt's follow-as-guidance carve-out names **that label**, never the tool. A loaded body does not taint (FR-T7). Every rejection and every budget drop reaches the owner as a notice.
  An allowlisted `/skills` request performs a fresh scan and lists every accepted descriptor and
  rejection without dispatching an agent turn or changing skill state.
- **FR-T10.** *(P-mcp)* **Remote (MCP) tools enter through the same registry and the same gate.** Tools discovered from an owner-configured MCP server are namespaced so they cannot collide with a built-in, default to the **`ask`** tier with arbitrary-destination egress, and mark their results as untrusted content; owner config may lower a **named** tool to `safe` and may never raise one to `dangerous`. The catalog is fixed for the lifetime of the process and folds into the policy version, so a change across a restart invalidates approvals bound to the old surface. Server credentials are stored encrypted and **bound to the server URL they were issued for**. An unreachable or misbehaving server is skipped with a reported reason and never blocks startup; a malformed owner config does fail startup. No model-reachable tool can add a server, alter the catalog, or read a credential.

### 6.8 Scheduler *(later phase)*
- **FR-C1.** Restart-safe scheduler stores jobs in SQLite (id, owner, due/recurrence, timezone, prompt/message, status, created/executed timestamps).
- **FR-C2.** A periodic ticker fires due jobs exactly once per occurrence (timezone/DST-correct) by comparing next-occurrence to wall-clock (not by counting ticks), with a misfire/catch-up policy that **collapses missed occurrences into at most one delivery** (clock-gap cap, to avoid a wake-time fire-storm), and **one authoritative** overlap guard (an atomic DB claim PENDING→RUNNING).
- **FR-C3.** Scheduled runs are normal agent runs (full context) at **reduced privilege** (no auto-approval; default-DENY on approval timeout; no untrusted-web ingestion while holding high-sensitivity memory) and deliver results to the owner's Telegram DM. A **new LLM-parsed schedule requires explicit owner confirmation before it arms.**
- **FR-C4.** Audit events for job create/execute/cancel/failure. Proactive runs have their own daily spend budget.

### 6.9 Execution / sandbox *(later phase)*
- **FR-X1.** Shell/code execution runs behind an `ExecutionBackend` protocol. Inc 5b supplies
  `apple/container` on macOS 26+ arm64: one untrusted execution = one disposable, never-reused
  hardware-virtualized VM. Linux gets a separately chosen backend in Inc 6; until a pinned
  Linux-host spike proves a microVM-conformant design, the Linux choice remains open.
- **FR-X2.** Secure-by-default exec exposes no live workspace, home, or ambient host bind mount.
  Approved inputs are copied into one daemon-owned, per-execution ephemeral scratch directory and
  that copy is the sole host mount, explicitly read-only. Egress is denied unless opted in;
  capabilities are dropped; resource caps and deterministic timeouts are explicit. Staging applies
  the same canonicalize + workspace-scope + secret-shaped-content checks as file tools and binds
  realpath/bytes by SHA-256; opted-in egress is `canExfiltrate=true`.

### 6.10 Operator UX
- **FR-O1.** *(commands land with their features)* Telegram command menu: at minimum `/start`, `/help`, `/status`, `/new`, `/stop`, `/cost` in v1; `/memory`, `/retry` in v1; `/model`, `/approve`, `/reject`, `/schedule`, `/cancel`, and `/skills` as their features land.
- **FR-O2.** *(v1)* **`status` / `doctor` self-check.** Exposed both as a **`clawd` CLI subcommand** and a Telegram **`/status`** command (distinct from the NG4 REST surface). It reports a concrete **per-subsystem health table** with a machine-readable JSON-to-stdout form pollable by launchd/systemd, covering at minimum: poller (connected, last update, last offset, last 409/429), LLM (last success, consecutive failures, last error class, retry budget), **LLM auth (provider, credential mode, and freshness — validated without a network call, and never printing a token or account id)**, DB (writable, WAL size, last checkpoint, free disk), runs (in-flight, oldest run age, last FAILED), and spend (today's USD, remaining budget). `doctor --check-config` validates config **without** starting the daemon, and a config/secret error is the **first thing** it prints.
  Full doctor and `/status` also report workspace-skill accepted and rejected counts plus
  complete-index fit against the absolute skills cap. A warning or over-cap index fails that
  headline row. `doctor --check-config` does not scan the workspace.
- **FR-O3.** *(v1)* **`/new` semantics.** `/new` starts a **fresh conversation window** and (with the tools phase) **detaints** the session — described to the owner as "clears anything the bot read from web/files this session." **Durable memory persists by design**; forgetting durable facts is the separate confirm-gated `/memory delete` path (FR-M6). `/new` also clears the session's pending confirmation entry (memory and exfil-approval kinds).

## 7. Non-functional requirements

- **NFR-Security.** Untrusted-inbound model; default-deny numeric-ID boundary; in-code policy enforcement; explicit instruction hierarchy (system/security policy > developer config > identity files (SOUL/AGENTS/TOOLS) > user task > tool observations > retrieved/inbound content > durable memory (MEMORY.md/USER.md — untrusted tier)); durable memory is injected in the untrusted/labeled wrapper and never the system tier (FR-M5); the "lethal trifecta" (private data + untrusted content + outbound comms) is an **enforced gate**, not a flag (FR-T7), covering **every outbound sink** (FR-T6); access and rate-limit checks **fail closed**; secrets never in replies/logs. **Fail-closed everywhere a security check can error internally.**
- **NFR-Privacy.** Local-first storage; data minimization; `0600/0700` file permissions; redaction at both the log boundary and the outbound-reply boundary (exact-value redaction of loaded secrets as the primary mechanism, pattern scanning as secondary); owner can export/delete (FR-S4); rely on OS full-disk encryption + an encrypted secret store + at-rest file encryption for the un-redacted message archive. Provider credentials live in their own encrypted envelope under the state root, and **tokens, account identifiers, device/authorization codes, and opaque provider replay payloads never appear in logs, replies, tool input, memory, or the search index** — a rotating credential is covered by the same exact-value redaction as a static one, across the rotation window.
- **NFR-Reliability.** Retries only on retryable errors with capped exponential backoff + full jitter at exactly one layer with a retry budget; **at-least-once** outbound delivery via the transactional outbox (FR-S3); crash-recoverable explicit run state machine with a boot reconciliation sweep; graceful shutdown; never silently loop (hard budgets stop and ask). Deterministic startup failures (bad config, missing secret, `409`, `SQLITE_FULL`) **back off rather than hot-loop**; disk-full refuses new turns and replies "storage full" once without crash-looping; `doctor` does a free-disk preflight.
- **NFR-Performance.** Responsive for an interactive DM assistant: typing indicator within ~1 s; **streaming time-to-first-token** is the felt-latency metric. Low idle footprint as an always-on daemon.
- **NFR-Portability.** Same source targets macOS and Linux. For early phases this is a **soft guideline** (keep portable protocol seams and AsyncHTTPClient/OpenAI-compat choices; pragmatic macOS-native code is permitted behind a protocol or flagged for audit), with **one hard gate** at the Linux portability/deployment phase: the CI Linux build must pass before release.
- **NFR-Operability.** Structured logs (swift-log) to stdout/stderr; an **ordinary append-only audit log** (actor, action, tool, redacted args, result size, decision, timestamp, run/session id) separate from app logs — useful for "why did it do that." (No hash-chaining / tamper-evidence claim in v1; if integrity is added later it requires an **external anchor** outside the daemon's writable scope.) Per-call token/cost capture; supervisor restart throttling documented in the launchd/systemd config; distinct non-retryable exit codes for config-validation and secret-load failures.
- **NFR-Maintainability/Testability.** Small, well-bounded modules with inward-only dependencies; pure domain core; mockable transport + provider; a top-level **error taxonomy** (`ProviderError / TelegramError / PolicyDenied / BudgetExhausted / StoreError / ConfigError`, each tagged retryable | terminal | user-visible); unit + integration tests (Swift Testing).
- **NFR-Cost.** A **USD spend breaker** is a v1 feature: a per-run cost ceiling **and** a rolling per-day cap, checked in code **before** each provider call (estimate input tokens + projected output); a hard kill-switch halts LLM calls and DMs the owner when the daily cap trips. Retries and any fallback count against both budgets; never silently fall back to a pricier tier. **A route switch is gated only by the preflight the round-trip already ran, so the switching round-trip's call can exceed the USD caps by one call** ([`ARCHITECTURE.md` §8.6]) — reviewed and accepted, and stated in the owner-facing spending docs. Token caps + the USD breaker are in v1; per-call USD attribution **dashboards** are deferred (NG9). Defaults for every budget (incl. `perRunUSD`, `perDayUSD`) are pinned in [`ARCHITECTURE.md` §5]. **On a plan-included route (FR-P5) the USD gates are inert by design** — there is no dollar cost to cap — while the token, turn, tool-call, and wall-clock ceilings and the daily token breaker stay fully enforced; usage still records with a confirmed zero and an `included_plan` source, so the audit trail stays complete and the two billing modes never share an identity.

## 8. Product principles (non-negotiables)

Distilled from the verified best-practices research:

1. **The harness acts, not the model.** The model only *proposes* a structured action; deterministic code validates, authorizes, executes, records, returns an observation.
2. **Enforce policy in code, not in the prompt.** Prompt text is defense-in-depth only.
3. **Default-deny, numeric-ID boundary; fail closed.** Reject unknown senders before any LLM/tool/expensive work; security checks deny on internal error.
4. **Untrusted inbound is data, never instructions.** Maintain a strict instruction hierarchy; the lethal-trifecta condition forces approval in code.
5. **Pause before the irreversible step.** Approvals bound to exact actions, expiring to deny, approvable only by the recorded owner.
6. **Hard budgets are product features.** Turns, tool-calls, tokens, wall-time, **USD**, retries — on exhaustion, stop and tell the owner (a concrete user-visible message, principle 10).
7. **Persist everything important; make side effects idempotent** (DB-internal dedup + transactional outbox; exactly-once across the network is impossible).
8. **Scarcity forces curation** (bounded memory) and **flush before compaction.**
9. **Boring over clever; ship a vertical slice end-to-end first** — but v1 must be a *useful* slice (memory + read-only web/file + streaming), not a robust echo.
10. **Anti-sycophancy & honest degradation:** no fabricated numeric confidence; state assumptions and ask on ambiguous irreversible actions; on failure the owner sees a plain-language message, never silence or a raw error.

## 9. Scope & phasing

**v1 = the daily-driver milestone.** It is *conversational + durable memory + read-only tools + streaming* — the smallest slice that earns daily use over the official ChatGPT/Claude apps. We still build it increment-by-increment (see the roadmap), but the success criteria below are claimed only for slices that can actually earn daily use.

**In v1:** conversational core; durable memory (remember-on-confirm + FTS5 recall); read-only tools (`web_search`, `web_fetch`, workspace file READ — all `safe` tier, no sandbox/approval); streaming replies; the USD spend breaker; onboarding/first-run; non-text intake handling; user-visible degradation; data export/delete; single-instance guard + 409 handling; `status`/`doctor`; the optional fallback route (FR-R3).

**Deferred to later phases:** write/shell/code tools + sandbox + approvals + the enforced lethal-trifecta gate; scheduling/proactive (its own phase); ChatGPT subscription authentication (its own phase); tools from MCP servers (its own phase); a roster longer than two routes; per-call USD attribution dashboards.

| Phase | Capability | Headline outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **v1 — Daily driver** | §5.1, §5.2, §5.3 | Supervised default-deny Telegram DM → real OpenAI-compatible **streaming** LLM answer; persisted; multi-turn; per-session FIFO lane + `/stop` + `/new`; durable memory on confirm + FTS5 recall; read-only `web_search`/`web_fetch`/file-read (`safe`, exfil-gated); USD breaker; onboarding; non-text handling; graceful degradation; export/delete; `doctor`; survives restart. |
| **P-tools** | §5.4 | Write/shell tools + in-code policy gate + Telegram approval flow (callback auth + nonce + FSM) + sandbox (`apple/container` in Inc 5b on macOS 26 arm64; Linux backend in Inc 6) + enforced lethal-trifecta gate. *Delivered in two increments — **5a** (approval fabric + write tools, no virtualization) then **5b** (sandbox + code execution); see [`ARCHITECTURE.md` §20].* |
| **P-schedule** | §5.5 | NL reminders; restart-safe DST-correct scheduler; confirm-before-arm; reduced-privilege proactive runs; opt-in heartbeat with quiet hours; delivery to DM. |
| **P-auth** | §5.6 | ChatGPT subscription login (`clawd auth login` / `status` / `logout`) + the ChatGPT Responses route behind the existing `LLMProvider` seam; one qualified model value selects it; no API key, no API billing, no new environment variables; the configured OpenAI-compatible route unchanged and still the default. *Independent of the v1→Linux build order — see [`ARCHITECTURE.md` §20].* |
| **P-skills** | §5.7 | Workspace skills the owner authors as `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`: scan-time identity, a one-line-per-skill index with a prefix-drop marker, a `safe` name-resolving loader that does not taint, a prompt carve-out scoped to the fence label, owner notices for every rejection and drop, complete on-demand `/skills` diagnostics, and summarized skill health in full doctor and `/status`. |
| **P-mcp** | §5.8 | MCP **client** over Streamable HTTP: owner-configured servers' tools join the registry beside the built-ins at the `ask` tier with untrusted results and arbitrary-destination egress; per-server tokens encrypted and URL-bound; catalog pinned at boot and folded into the policy version; an unreachable server is skipped with a reported reason; `clawd mcp list`/`probe` and a status-only `/mcp` are the whole ops surface. *Independent of the v1→Linux build order — see [`ARCHITECTURE.md` §20].* |
| **P-portability** | — | Linux portability + deployment (static SDK, distroless/systemd, CI Linux gate). |
| **Roadmap (later)** | — | Native Anthropic adapter (prompt caching); pairing flow; sqlite-vec recall (behind a protocol). |

A detailed technical increment roadmap (Increment 0…6, each with a "done-when" threshold; v1 = Inc 0–3) lives in [`ARCHITECTURE.md` §Roadmap](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 10. Success criteria

Each criterion is backed by an **automated acceptance test** (per-requirement verified-by-test); a phase is "done" only when its tests pass.

- **SC1 (v1).** From a cold machine boot, an allowlisted Telegram DM gets a context-aware **streaming** LLM answer; an un-allowlisted DM never reaches the model. State survives `kill -TERM` + restart. No formatting-related Telegram 400s. Two quick messages produce two **in-order, non-interleaved** replies. **A provider outage produces a graceful user-facing message, not silence or a raw error.**
- **SC2 (v1).** Tell it a fact today; it recalls that fact in a new session next week after restarts; the owner can review it with provenance and delete it.
- **SC3 (v1).** "Read this URL / my notes file and summarize" works with no approval tap (read-only `safe` tier); a fetch in a tainted, private-data-touching turn is gated by approval, and fetch args carrying secret-shaped tokens are blocked before dispatch; a `web_fetch` to a private/loopback/link-local/metadata address is refused (SSRF). v1's "gated by approval" is the ephemeral text approval: an in-memory single-slot pending entry whose `yes` arms a one-turn grant bound to the exact approved action (tool + canonical target; for `web_fetch`, the canonical URL); anything else — including restart — denies. The durable approval FSM, callback auth, and nonces remain Inc 5a.
- **SC4 (v1).** The daily USD cap trips a hard kill-switch that halts LLM calls and DMs the owner; the owner can export and delete their conversation history (including FTS rows).
- **SC5 (ops, v1).** `status`/`doctor` answers "which subsystem is wedged and since when, and is it safely configured?" in one command (per-subsystem table + JSON), `doctor --check-config` validates without starting the daemon, and a second `clawd` refuses to boot. *(No tamper-evident-audit claim.)*
- **SC6 (P-tools).** A consequential tool (file write / shell) cannot run without an explicit owner approval bound to the exact resolved action; untrusted code cannot read host secrets or reach the network by default; a tainted session is forced down the approval path in code; a forged or third-party callback cannot approve a pending action.
- **SC7 (P-schedule).** "Every weekday 07:00 Europe/Berlin…" fires once per weekday across restarts and a DST change; a new schedule arms only after explicit confirmation.
- **SC8 (P-portability).** The same source produces a running, supervised binary on a fresh Linux box; the CI Linux build passes.
- **SC9 (P-auth).** With no API key configured, `clawd auth login` completes a device-code login and prints the exact `CLAW_LLM_MODEL=openai-chatgpt/<model>` line; applying it, an allowlisted DM gets a streaming answer over the subscription route, recorded with its token counts, a confirmed **zero USD**, and an `included_plan` cost source. **Every other model value still routes to the configured OpenAI-compatible endpoint with unchanged URL and key behavior.** `clawd auth status` reports freshness with no network call; concurrent turns share exactly one token refresh, and a stale request cannot invalidate a newer token. An expired credential tells the owner to stop the daemon and log in, while an entitlement or quota failure says what it is and **does not**. Token, turn, tool-call, and wall-clock caps still stop a run. **No test contacts OpenAI.**
- **SC10 (P-skills).** A `SKILL.md` the owner installed reaches the model as a **loadable** skill: the index renders under the skills label, the model loads a body **by name** and follows it, and the session stays untainted so high-sensitivity memory still assembles afterwards. A path-shaped name resolves against the scan like any other name and misses, and a symlinked skill directory is refused; an unknown name **succeeds**, listing the installed names; two directories claiming one name refuse and name both. Manifests the scan rejected and skills the budget dropped both reach the owner as notices, and the prompt says how many of how many skills it is showing.
  `/skills` returns every accepted descriptor and rejection from a fresh scan without starting a
  turn. Full `clawd doctor`, its JSON form, and `/status` report the same fresh accepted count,
  rejected count, and absolute-cap fit; warnings or overflow fail the headline row.

## 11. Constraints & assumptions

- Pure Swift; Swift 6 strict concurrency; SwiftPM; **platform floor macOS 15** (`Calendar.RecurrenceRule` for the Inc 4 scheduler — Linux re-validation stays inside the Inc 6 gate).
- macOS 26 + Apple Silicon for `apple/container` (P-tools); Linux needs a separate sandbox backend.
- One owner; Telegram Bot API; long-polling.
- LLM access via an OpenAI-compatible endpoint the owner configures, with a pinned/allowlisted `base_url` — or, on the subscription route (FR-P5), a ChatGPT account the owner logs into, against a fixed endpoint that is a compile-time constant rather than configuration.
- Configuration is environment-based; structured configuration (`config.toml`) is deferred, and no per-provider environment namespace is introduced in its place (NG10).
- Single machine per deployment (no clustering); a single-instance startup lock enforces one daemon per state root.
- A bounded, non-null `max_tokens` and a configured USD spend cap are required at startup (`doctor` rejects otherwise).

## 12. Risks & open questions

- **R1.** Telegram thin-client correctness (offset ordering, 409 conflict, 429 flood-control) — mitigated by the FR-G2 durability invariant + single-instance guard + typed 409 + tests.
- **R2.** `apple/container` is macOS-26/Apple-Silicon-only. Inc 5b therefore ships the macOS
  backend only; Linux execution remains absent until Inc 6 resolves and proves its backend.
- **R3.** OpenAI-compat shims lag native features (Anthropic prompt caching, some tool-calling quirks) — acceptable; the `LLMProvider` protocol leaves an escape hatch, now exercised: the ChatGPT Responses adapter (FR-P5) is the seam's first non-Chat-Completions wire format.
- **R4.** `sqlite-vec` (vector search) requires a custom SQLite amalgamation + separate Linux re-validation — keep strictly behind a protocol and deferred; FTS5/BM25 is the v1 recall mechanism.
- **R5.** Prompt injection has no reliable model-level fix — rely on least-privilege, the enforced trifecta gate, and approvals, not a classifier; the memory-write scan is defense-in-depth only.
- **R6.** GRDB + FTS5 on Linux is contributor-supported (FTS5 may not be compiled into the platform SQLite) — mitigated by vendoring the SQLite amalgamation with FTS5 compiled in and a Linux CI job; risk is **Low (macOS) / Med (Linux until our own CI exists)**.
- **R7.** The ChatGPT subscription route (FR-P5) is **unofficial and provider-dependent**: it is derived from behavior observed in two reference implementations, **not** from a public, supported third-party ChatGPT inference API. The vendor can change or withdraw its endpoints, headers, device flow, or event shapes **without notice**, and the vendor's terms govern what a subscription may be used for. **Risk accepted deliberately, with the blast radius bounded by design:** the route is confined to its own credential and wire adapters, adds nothing to the path of an owner who does not select it, and the supported OpenAI-compatible route stays the default and is one model-value change away. swift-claw does not claim this route is stable or supported and must never document it as such.
- **OQ1.** HTML vs MarkdownV2 as the default Telegram parse mode (HTML is less 400-prone).
- **OQ2.** Linux sandbox backend (Inc 6): KVM-backed microVM versus an explicitly amended
  userspace-kernel profile, decided only after the pinned Linux-host spike.

*(Resolved and removed from open questions: memory write policy = confirm-on-write; context counting unit = graphemes; memory caps = 2200/1375; error-on-overflow is the v1 contract.)*
