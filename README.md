**Your always-on personal AI assistant. One pure-Swift daemon on hardware you own.**

`clawd` pairs a private Telegram bot with the LLM of your choice. It remembers what you
tell it and runs scheduled and proactive tasks. Consequential tool calls wait for your
approval. Everything it keeps stays in one directory on your own machine: a SQLite
database, encrypted secret envelopes, and Markdown files you edit by hand.

## Features

- **One binary.** Swift 6 with strict concurrency, from the Telegram long-poll down to SQLite.
- **A real Telegram chat.** Answers stream in as live message drafts. `/stop` cancels a
  turn, `/new` starts a fresh session, clawd transcribes voice notes on-device
  (macOS 26), and it looks at photos you send if your model can see them.
- **Durable memory.** Facts you confirm persist in SQLite, and clawd recalls them by
  importance and recency. Workspace Markdown files hold your profile, notes, and daily
  logs, and conversation history is full-text searchable.
- **Skills you write once.** A `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` file shows up in context as its name
  and one line about when to use it; when a task matches, clawd loads the body and follows
  your procedure instead of asking you to paste it again. Send `/skills` to see every
  accepted skill and each file the scanner rejected.
- **Proactive, on your clock.** "Every weekday at 07:00" schedules fire once per
  occurrence across restarts and DST changes, and an opt-in heartbeat respects quiet hours.
- **Scheduled tasks that learn from feedback.** Opt in with `CLAW_LEARNING_ENABLED=true`.
  Correct one result to start a bounded lesson trial; two positive runs can promote it.
  Inspect lessons and roll back a promotion with `/learning`.
- **Tools behind a policy engine.** `web_fetch` sits behind an SSRF gate; writes and code
  execution wait for an explicit tap-to-approve in Telegram. clawd enforces policy in
  code and treats inbound content as data, never as instructions.
- **Sandboxed code execution.** Untrusted code runs in a fresh disposable VM per request
  (macOS 26 arm64, off by default).
- **Coding tasks from chat.** Opt in to Coder to delegate an approved task from your DM or a
  configured group topic to your native Codex installation, then receive a structured result card
  when the background job finishes. Local changes and GitHub pull requests use your installed tools
  and repository rights.
- **Tools from MCP servers.** List a server, store its token encrypted, and its tools join
  the built-ins as the least-trusted tools clawd has. Calls ask by default; you may mark a
  named tool safe, but the exfiltration gate can still require approval. Only you can add a
  server or change what it exposes.
- **Bring your own model.** Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works, and `clawd auth login`
  can run an eligible model on a ChatGPT subscription.

## The approval card

  />
</p>

A file write suspends the run until you answer. Every field on the card comes from the daemon's own
record of the action: the target path after symlink and `..` resolution, the size, and a preview of
the content. Coder uses a dedicated card with the complete source, workspace, publication scope,
provided task or selected issue, and optional additional requirements; its completion card puts the
outcome first and keeps technical evidence compact. Tap Deny and clawd writes nothing.

## Install

**Conference organizers:** start with the standalone Russian
[conference setup guide](docs/CONFERENCE.md). It covers a fresh Mac, builds
`feature/conference-coding-challenge` / PR #199 without merging into `main`, and installs
a dedicated binary, state root and LaunchAgent. The release installer below targets `~/.swift-claw`.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivan-magda/swift-claw/main/install.sh | sh
```

Everything lands in `~/.swift-claw`, with no sudo. The script verifies every download
against the release checksums, stages the service files, and prints the next steps.
Pin a release with `curl … | CLAWD_VERSION=v0.2.0 sh`, read the
[script source](install.sh) first, or follow the manual route in
[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) (macOS 15+ arm64; Linux x86_64 with glibc 2.38+).

Or build from source with a Swift 6.3 toolchain (Linux needs `libsqlite3-dev`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivan-magda/swift-claw.git && cd swift-claw
swift build -c release
sudo install -m755 .build/release/clawd /usr/local/bin/clawd
```

## Quick start

1. Get a bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) (send `/newbot`).
2. Edit `~/.swift-claw/clawd.env`: set the token and your LLM provider
   (`CLAW_LLM_BASE_URL`, `CLAW_LLM_MODEL`, `CLAW_LLM_API_KEY`).
3. Load the config and encrypt your secrets at rest:
   `set -a && . ~/.swift-claw/clawd.env && set +a && clawd secrets seal`
4. Say hello once in the foreground: `clawd run`, then send `/start` to your bot. The
   refusal shows your numeric ID; set it as `CLAW_ALLOWLIST=<id>` in `clawd.env`, then
   Ctrl-C.
5. Check health and start the service:
   `set -a && . ~/.swift-claw/clawd.env && set +a && clawd doctor`, then run the start
   command doctor prints.

The full walkthrough, including the ChatGPT-subscription route and troubleshooting, is
in [docs/GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

In Telegram, `/schedule` creates or lists jobs; `/runnow <jobId>` runs one now;
`/pause`, `/resume`, and `/cancel` control a job. `/learning <jobId>` shows its lessons and
trial, and `/learning reset <jobId>` asks you to confirm an empty lesson set. `/help` lists
commands and confirmation rules.

## Security model

swift-claw assumes you are the only person it serves in its normal personal deployment. Configured
groups are a supervised exception: use a separate nonpersonal state root, trust the participants,
and understand that their ordinary tool approvals are relaxed; see
[group Coder configuration](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#coder-configuration).
The separate [conference challenge profile](docs/CONFERENCE.md) accepts participant proposals in
configured groups and forum topics through a fixed tool surface, with no personal memory or ordinary
tools. Only the proposal's author can confirm it; private messages are ignored. It requires
a dedicated nonpersonal host/account, state root and publication bot credential. Optional
`CLAW_GROUP_TOPICS` entries restrict intake to exact `chat_id:thread_id` pairs. Group Privacy must
be disabled; conference approval binds the author's numeric ID and does not require bot admin rights.
The operator can select one fixed `CLAW_CONFERENCE_CASE_FILE` or a
`CLAW_CONFERENCE_SEASON_FILE` whose time zone and weekday entries switch the trusted challenge
context automatically; the file is loaded once at startup.

- **Default-deny.** Only allowlisted Telegram IDs get a conversation. clawd refuses
  everyone else, and answers `/start` with the sender's own numeric ID so you can
  allowlist them. `CLAW_ALLOWLIST` only ever adds, so revoking an ID means deleting its
  row from the database ([details](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#everything-else)).
- **Secrets encrypted at rest.** `clawd secrets seal` wraps the bot token and API keys in
  an AES-GCM envelope. Plaintext env secrets remain available as a dev fallback that
  warns on every boot.
- **Approvals are durable and bound to their prompt.** In your DM, file writes, memory writes, code
  execution, and native Coder submissions suspend into a durable state machine until you decide. In
  a configured group, Coder submission is the one action that always asks: any current participant
  can approve or deny from its original approval message, and clawd checks membership with Telegram
  at the tap. Pending approvals expire to deny.
- **Prompt injection contained in the personal deployment.** Messages, web content, tool output,
  and stored memory
  enter the context as untrusted data. Once a session has both ingested untrusted content
  and pulled your private files into context, fetching an arbitrary URL also needs your
  approval. clawd pins your LLM and search providers in config, and the model cannot
  redirect them.

The full model is in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) (§12). To report a
vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Customize your agent

Persona and behavior live in Markdown files under `~/.swift-claw/workspace/`:

| File | Shapes | Trust |
|---|---|---|
| `SOUL.md` | Personality and tone | System prompt |
| `AGENTS.md` | Behavior rules | System prompt |
| `TOOLS.md` | When and how to use tools | System prompt |
| `USER.md` | Who you are | Untrusted, labeled |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | The proactive heartbeat checklist | Heartbeat runs only |
| `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | A procedure the agent loads when a task calls for it | Untrusted, labeled |

MCP servers go in `~/.swift-claw/mcp.yaml`, with their tokens stored encrypted by
`clawd mcp set-token`. Other runtime knobs are environment variables: the model route
(`CLAW_LLM_MODEL`), an optional fallback route (`CLAW_LLM_FALLBACK_MODEL`, off unless you
set it), silent Telegram delivery (`CLAW_TELEGRAM_SILENT_MESSAGES`), USD budgets, schedules and
quiet hours, voice locales, sandbox limits.
[`.env.example`](.env.example) documents every variable;
[docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md) is the guide.

Experimental benchmarks, corpora and the Swift evaluation harness live in
[swift-claw-evals](https://github.com/ivan-magda/swift-claw-evals). The daemon's scheduled-learning
implementation and product tests stay in this repository. Building and testing `clawd` does not
require the laboratory.
